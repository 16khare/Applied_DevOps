         <p>
            Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
            Originally developed and designed by engineers at Google as the Borg project, Kubernetes was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2015. Red Hat® was one of the first companies to work with Google on Kubernetes, even prior to launch, and has become the 2nd-most leading contributor to the Kubernetes upstream project.

        <h1 style="font-size: 50px";>Kubernetes Cluster</h1>
        <p>
            A working Kubernetes deployment is called a cluster, which is a group of hosts running Linux containers. You can visualize a Kubernetes cluster as two parts: the control plane and the compute machines, or nodes.
            Each node is its own Linux environment, and could be either a physical or virtual machine. Each node runs pods, which are made up of containers.

            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The control plane is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster, such as which applications are running and which container images they use. Compute machines actually run the applications and workloads. The control plane takes commands from an administrator (or DevOps team) and relays those instructions to the compute machines.

            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                This handoff works with a multitude of services to automatically decide which node is best suited for the task. Services decouple work definitions from the pods and automatically get service requests to the right pod—no matter where it moves in the cluster or even if it’s been replaced. It allocates resources and assigns the pods in that node to fulfill the requested work.


            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

                Kubernetes runs on top of an operating system  and interacts with pods of containers running on the nodes.
                The desired state of a Kubernetes cluster defines which applications or other workloads should be running, along with which images they use, which resources should be made available to them, and other such configuration details.

        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            There is little change to how you manage containers using this type of infrastructure. Your involvement just happens at a higher level, giving you better control without the need to micromanage each separate container or node.


        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Where you run Kubernetes is up to you. This can be on bare metal servers, virtual machines (VMs), public cloud providers, private clouds, and hybrid cloud environments. One of Kubernetes’ key advantages is it works on many different kinds of infrastructure.

        <p>
            Kubernetes can help you deliver and manage containerized, legacy, and cloud-native apps, as well as those being refactored into microservices.
In order to meet changing business needs, your development team needs to be able to rapidly build new applications and services. Cloud-native development starts with microservices in containers, which enables faster development and makes it easier to transform and optimize existing applications.

            </p>

                Application development with Kubernetes
                </p>
                <p>
Production apps span multiple containers, and those containers must be deployed across multiple server hosts. Kubernetes gives you the orchestration and management capabilities required to deploy containers, at scale, for these workloads.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Kubernetes orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule those containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage the health of those containers over time. With Kubernetes you can take effective steps toward better IT security.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Kubernetes also needs to integrate with networking, storage, security, telemetry, and other services to provide a comprehensive container infrastructure.
                Once you scale this to a production environment and multiple applications, it's clear that you need multiple, colocated containers working together to deliver the individual services.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Linux containers give your microservice-based apps an ideal application deployment unit and self-contained execution environment. And microservices in containers make it easier to orchestrate services, including storage, networking, and security.
