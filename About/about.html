                Hello Everyone! First of all a very warm welcome to you and a big thank you for visiting our website.
                We are pre-final year BTech Computer Science students of Univeristy of Petroleum and Energy Studies,Dehradun.We decided to team up for a group project and decided to build up a website which will be solemnly dedicated to DEVOPS.We are from the DevOps specialization and hence could easily see that there is no  single
                website which is completely dedicated to DevOps and the things related to it.So,we took this initiative and added this to our project.
                This webiste is open to all who are eager to know about our DevOps culture and other related informations.This website will give up the entire information with proper guidance in terms of documents as well as videos for better understanding.
                So,do not wait anymore and expand your knowledge and kindly provide us your feedback to our provided email address in the Contact Us section.

                <br>
                Just for a short Introduction: (left-right)
<br>
                Chirag Khare,
                Aastha Mishra.
